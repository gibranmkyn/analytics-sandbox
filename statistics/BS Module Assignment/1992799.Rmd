A financial conduct regulator needs to investigate the effect of payday loans. A dataset of a survey from 5,000 customers where they reported their well-being and a measure of their socio-economic status linked to their credit file is available.

Two questions arose: \n
1. Does receiving a payday loan change well-being? If so, how much? \n
2. Does taking payday loan makes people more or less likely to experience an adverse credit event?

# Does receiving a payday loan change well-being? If so, how much? 

> Yes, loan significantly affects well-being by a decrease of .132 in well-being score if one receives payday loan, 95% CI[(-.242) – (-.022)], and no decrease otherwise, given SES and credit score held constant.

Individually, loan, SES, and credit score have significant effect and a positive correlation when used as a predictor of well-being. Put it simply, as one increases, well-being increases too. However, well-being is best explained by using the combination of loan, credit.score, and SES as predictors using a multiple regression model, $R^2$ = .694. Figure 1 describes how each predictor changes well-being when used together.

![](figure-1.png) 

Figure 1. Regression coefficient of credit score, loan, and SES to describe the change in well-being per each unit increase.

Relative to other predictors, although still significant, loan has the least significant effect towards well-being, $F(1,4996)=7.456$, $p = .006$. This is expected since loan and credit.score are highly correlated, $R^2$ = .494, whilst credit score can explain well-being better than loan, $R^2$ = .494 and $R^2$ = .354 respectively. Thus, making the model shifts its attention more to credit score than loan when it comes to predicting well-being.

As for the magnitude of change, holding credit.score and SES constant, one unit increase on loan variable predicts a decrease of .132 unit of well-being 95% CI[(-.242) – (-.022)]. Such change is significant, $t(4996) = -2.359$, $p < .001$.

# Does taking payday loan makes people more or less likely to experience an adverse credit event?

> Those taking payday loan are less likely to experience adverse credit event. And Social Economic Status does not have a significant effect on adverse credit event nor on the relationship loan has with adverse credit event.

![](figure-2.png) 
Figure 2. A comparison of probability estimate on adverse credit event given loan (and SES)

Figure 2 describes the difference in probability of experiencing adverse credit event (ACE) when receiving a loan and a comparison of how insignificant SES affect the probabilities as SES increases. The dashed line is the probability estimate for ACE given a loan or not (without SES), the dots describes the individuals who either experienced ACE or not, the +s are the proportion of ACE in each SES rank, while the line and ribbon are the fit of a logistic regression model and its 95% CI given SES.

The effects of loan on ACE is significant, $\chi^2(4998)$=6644.6, $p$<.0001. In contrast, SES has almost no effect on ACE,  $\chi^2$(4997)=6643.7, $p$=.339 nor on the relationship loan has with ACE, $\chi^2(4996)$=6643.6, $p$=.339.

The probability of those taking payday loan to experience ACE, .357 95% CI[.339 – .376], is lower than those who do not, .586 95% CI[.566 – .606], about an absolute .229 change in probability.

`loan` and `credit.score` has relatively high correlation with each other ($R^2 = .743$), . However, `credit.score` ($R^2 = .494$) can explain well.being better than loan ($R^2 = .354$). Therefore, it is within expectation that `credit.score` might be a more significant independant variable than loan in a multiple regression for well.being.

```{r question-1: Model Fitting, message=FALSE}
# --------- Linear regression on bivariate
LM_loan <- lm(well.being~ loan, data=payday)
LM_credit.score <- lm(well.being~ credit.score, data=payday) 
LM_ses <- lm(well.being~ SES, data=payday) 

# --------- Multiple regression models for well.being
LM_credit.loan <- lm(well.being~ credit.score + loan, data=payday) # model1, without SES 
LM_credit.loan.ses <- lm(well.being ~ credit.score + loan + SES , data=payday)  # model2, including SES
```
`LM_credit.loan` has loan and credit.score as independent variables for well.being. While, `LM_credit.loan.ses` in addition to what `LM_credit.loan` has, SES is added.

```{r question-1: NHST, message=FALSE}
# --------- NHST whether the variables are significant in a bivariate setup
anova(LM_loan) 
anova(LM_credit.score)
anova(LM_ses)

# --------- NHST whether the variance differ between multiple regression model with and without SES
#H0: LM_credit.loan == LM_credit.loan.ses ; HA: LM_credit.loan != LM_credit.loan.ses 
anova(LM_credit.loan, LM_credit.loan.ses) 

# --------- NHST the significance of the variables
# For each variable... H0: model with variable == model without variable ; HA: model with variable != model without variable
anova(LM_credit.loan.ses) 
```
All bivariate LMs has significant effect on `well.being`, but when put together, the significance of loan shifts to `credit.score`. This comes back again to the fact that `credit.score` and `loan` are highly correlated. But `credit.score` still have the upperhand when it comes to predicting `well.being`.

The `LM_credit.loan.ses` fits significantly better, F=3272.5 and p < .0001, with an increase of 0.2 in $R^2$ and a decrease in 3309 of RSS compared to `LM_credit.loan`. We can say that adding `SES` explains an additional 20% of the variance in well being and it is statistically significant. 

All independent variables in `LM_credit.loan.ses` are significant, but compared to `credit.score` and `credit.score`, `loan` is the least significant, p=.006.

```{r question-1: Estimation}
# --------- the equation for wellbeing
summary(LM_credit.loan.ses)
cbind(coef(LM_credit.loan.ses), confint(LM_credit.loan.ses)) #Confidence interval of the estimate
```
`well.being` can be explained through the following equation:
$\widehat{well.being} = -9.588 + 0.017 \times credit.score - 0.132 \times loan + 0.332 \times SES$

As for the magnitude of change, holding `credit.score` and `SES` constant, one unit increase on loan variable predicts a decrease of .132 units on `well.being` 95% CI[(-.242) – (-.022)]. Such change is significant, $t(4996) = -2.359$, $p < .001$.

The negative coefficient of `loan` can be explained by the multiple colinearity with `credit.score`, the binary input, and the constraint of 7 scales of `well.being`. Simply put, `loan` balances `credit.score`'s impact by going to the opposite direction when `loan` == 1.
